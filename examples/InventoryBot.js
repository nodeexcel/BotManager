/**
 * This is a simple example of a bot that will hook into the API and provide an Inventory system
 * In which a bot will accept any trades in-which people offer something and he offers nothing.
 * and
 * bot will accept any trades done by an admin in-which the bot offers something and the admin offers nothing.
 *
 * Make sure you copy this file and not use it directly. Follow install instructions on github.
